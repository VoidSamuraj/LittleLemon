# Little Lemon
## Description
Android app which was final task in Coursera Android Developer Course. I implemented only necessary parts witch was graded:

  - Is there a wireframe image for the design of the Home screen, upon which the actual screen in the app is based?
  - Are you greeted with an Onboarding screen when the app is opened for the first time, which prompts you to enter your personal details?
  - Does the layout of the Home screen contain the following sections: hero and the food menu list?
  - When accessed, is the Profile screen populated with the data you entered during onboarding?
  - Are user details presented in the Profile screen retained when the app is restarted?
  - Does clicking the Log out button clear all data from the Profile screen?
  - Does the app use stack navigation that allows you to access the previous screen using the back button?
  - Does the hero section contain a brief description of the Little Lemon restaurant and a search bar?
  - Does the food menu list section display a summarized view of the menu items?
  - Can you suggest any ways in which this app could be improved?
